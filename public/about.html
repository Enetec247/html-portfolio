<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design and functionality. I specialize in building responsive,<br>
   user-friendly websites that provide great experiences across all devices. Currently, I'm working on my first portfolio<br>
    website to showcase my projects, skills, and growth in web development.

  I enjoy working with modern web technologies and constantly strive to improve my coding skills. Whether it's front-end<br>
   development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or diving into frameworks like React, I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
  
  My goal is to create impactful digital experiences that not only look great but also function seamlessly. I believe in clean code,<br>
   continuous learning, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web..</p>
